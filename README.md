# Let's get educating

The Bitcoin Developer Network (BDN) is a community-driven project looking at educating the next wave of Bitcoin cypherpunks. This is a public invitation for developers, authors, editors, proofreaders, enthusiasts, subject matter experts and technical writers to get in touch so that we may reduce the barrier to entry in developing solutions at various layers of this technology.

Feel free to submit a pull request using the template.md to kick off a review process and have this communicated via the bitcoin developer network.

Alternatively, get in touch at inbox@bitcoindev.network
