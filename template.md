## Introduction

from Jameson Loop's article,
"Satoshi Roundtable V Recap"

"We also agreed that it would be extremely helpful 
if a standard was formed for securely splitting seed phrases." and 

"this could be a pretty big win if someone were to put in the time to develop a proposal."


Irony
It’s ironic that, as a whole, our community relishes the importance of decentralization for our network’s security, yet as individuals, we centralize upon ourselves all of the personal danger of a Wrench-Attack by holding ALL our own seed-words.

It’s even more ironic considering that it’s only now, with Bitcoin, that we can eliminate this most dangerous of attack vectors.

## Background

Recently
With recent price increases and kidnappings becoming more common, many people are concerned with the security of their BTC, and more specifically, their private-keys. Unfortunately, recommending hardware wallets, firearms, and pass-phrases seem to be the only solutions offered.

However, we need not expose ourselves as a single-point-of-failure.

I am proud to present — one of Bitcoin’s first mnemonic seed-word management protocols.


## Let's get started

Aims
The aims of the protocol are:

first, to preemptively discourage attacks from happening
second, to quickly resolve them
third, to prolong the time-length of the attack — thus preserving your health; and
lastly, to minimize your BTC losses

## Conclusion

Wrench Attacks are bloody and scary and we are all targets! And I’m sad to say that, as a community, we have not prepared… Here in meat-space, we still don’t have simple, widely-known solutions to safely hodl our private-keys.

We need to develop strategies, make resources, and spread this information so that every OG Hodler and every normie-noobie is as safe as possible. If we eliminate this single-point-of-failure, the safer and stronger we are, both individually, and as a community.
